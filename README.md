# chat-app

Basic chat app with "modern" glassmorphism effect. 
React front-end and Node back-end. Utilizes Knex.js to store and retrieve messages in MySQL2 database.
Websockets are used for real-time communication.
Users can create a username for themself (just stored in local storage, no real authentication for this) and switch between chatrooms. Also has the ability to create new chatrooms.

Still working on styling to create a cleaner, crisper look and checking for any bugs.
